Sentinel node biopsy compared with complete axillary dissection for staging early breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes: results of randomized trial. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) staging is currently used to avoid complete axillary dissection in breast cancer patients with negative SLNs. Evidence of a similar efficacy, in terms of survival and regional control, of this strategy as compared with axillary resection is based on few clinical trials. In 1998, we started a randomized study comparing the two strategies, and we present here its results. Patients were randomly assigned to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary dissection [axillary lymph node dissection (ALND arm)] or to SLNB plus axillary resection if SLNs contained metastases (SLNB arm). Main end points were overall survival (OS) and axillary recurrence. One hundred and fifteen patients were assigned to the ALND arm and 110 to the SLNB arm. A positive SLN was found in 27 patients in the ALND arm and in 31 in the SLNB arm. Overall accuracy of SLNB was 93.0%. Sensitivity and negative predictive values were 77.1% and 91.1%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 5.5 years, no axillary recurrence was observed in the SLNB arm. OS and event-free survival were not statistically different between the two arms. The SLNB procedure does not appear inferior to conventional ALND for the subset of patients here considered.
