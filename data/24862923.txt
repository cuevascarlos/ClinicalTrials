Early experience with ultrasound features after intrabeam intraoperative radiation for early stage breast cancer. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is an emerging option for partial breast radiotherapy in select women with early stage breast cancer. We assessed short-term clinical and sonographic findings after breast conservation (BCT) and IORT. An IRB-approved, single institution retrospective chart review was conducted of patients (pts) treated with BCT/IORT from 1/2011 to 6/2012. Follow-up clinical breast exams and ultrasounds (US) obtained 6 and 12 months after BCT/IORT were retrospectively reviewed by a single breast radiologist (JD) for sonographic findings. P values were calculated using McNemar's test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, and Chi-square. Seventy-one pts underwent BCT/IORT and 38 pts had an US. All 38 pts had a seroma, 10/38 (26%) pts were symptomatic. Eighteen pts had deep tissue closure (DTC) of the lumpectomy cavity with 5/18 (28%) DTC pts being symptomatic at follow-up versus 5/33 (15%) without DTC (P = 0.296). At 6 months, DTC resulted in smaller seroma cavity volumes compared to those without DTC (P = 0.03). Presence of a seroma is commonplace post BCT/IORT; symptomatic seromas are uncommon. DTC generated smaller seromas. Longer follow-up with serial US performed in all BCT/IORT pts could be considered to document natural progression/regression of symptoms and seromas.
