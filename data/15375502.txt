1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil + cyclophosphamide + tamoxifen versus CMF + tamoxifen in women with lymph node-positive breast cancer after primary surgery: a randomized controlled trial. We studied the usefulness of the oral 5-FU anti-cancer drug 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU) + cyclophosphamide (CPM) + tamoxifen (TAM) (HCT group) in comparison with CMF + TAM (CMFT group) in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer by a non-inferiority study based on a multi-institutional joint study. Clinical stage I, II primary breast cancers with histologically positive axillary lymph node metastasis were randomly assigned to the HCT group or the CMFT group after primary surgery. We registered 136 cases (HCT group 68 cases, CMFT group 68 cases). No significant difference in the 5-year overall survival rate (OS) and the 5-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) was found between the two groups. In the stratified analysis, DFS in cases in which the number of metastatic lymph nodes was 1-3 was significantly better in the HCT group (HCT group 84.3%, CMFT group 69.4%, log-rank test p=0.0496). No significant difference in the total incidence of adverse effects was found between the two groups, but there were significantly less adverse effects of grade 2 or over in the HCT group (p=0.034). The QOL survey at 3 months after surgery showed a significant decline of the QOL regarding lassitude, degree of difficulty in daily life, satisfaction with treatment and present mood in the CMFT group. Study results suggest that 2-year HCT therapy including the oral 5-FU anti-cancer drug HCFU is a useful adjuvant therapy which can replace CMFT therapy in early breast cancer cases with 3 or lower metastatic lymph nodes.
