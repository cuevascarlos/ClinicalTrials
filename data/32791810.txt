[Phase Ⅲ randomized controlled, multicenter, prospective study of recombinant anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody (Cipterbin) combined with vinorelbine in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer: the HOPES Study]. Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody (Cipterbin) combined with vinorelbine in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Patients were randomized 2∶1 to test group and control group. Patients in test group received Cipterbin (4 mg/kg loading dose and 2 mg/kg maintenance dose each week, IV) combined with vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) on days 1,8 and 15 of each 28 days, IV). Patients in control group received vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) on days 1,8 and 15 of each 28 days, IV). The primary end point was progression free survival (PFS). Results: A total of 315 patients were enrolled from Jan 2009 to Jan 2013 (212 in test group and 103 in control group). The median PFS of test group was significantly longer than that of control group, 39.1 weeks vs 14.0 weeks (HR=0.24; 95%CI, 0.16-0.36; P<0.000 1). The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in test group were significantly higher than those in control group, ORR was 46.7% vs 18.45% (P<0.000 1) and DCR was 79.72% vs 45.63% (P<0.000 1). The incidence of neutropenia, leucopenia and erythrocytopenia were higher in both groups, but there was no significant difference between two groups. The most common adverse events associated with Cipterbin were infusion reactions. Left ventricular ejection fraction reduced to less than 50% in 5 patients, which were recovered. No serious cardiotoxicity. Conclusion: The recombinant anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody (Cipterbin) combined with vinorelbine has significant efficacy and good safety. It is the optimized therapy regime for patients with taxane-pretreated HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, which provides more targeted therapy opportunities for HER2 positive breast cancer patients in China.
