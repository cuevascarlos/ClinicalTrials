Randomized active-controlled phase II study of denosumab efficacy and safety in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases. Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand, suppresses bone resorption. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of five dosing regimens of denosumab in patients with breast cancer-related bone metastases not previously treated with intravenous bisphosphonates (IV BPs). Eligible women (n = 255) with breast cancer-related bone metastases were stratified by type of antineoplastic therapy received and randomly assigned to one of six cohorts (five denosumab cohorts [blinded to dose and frequency]; one open-label IV BP cohort). Denosumab was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks (30, 120, or 180 mg) or every 12 weeks (60 or 180 mg). The primary end point was percentage of change in the bone turnover marker urine N-telopeptide corrected for urine creatinine (uNTx/Cr) from baseline to study week 13. The percentage of patients achieving more than 65% uNTx/Cr reduction, time to more than 65% uNTx/Cr reduction, patients experiencing one or more on-study skeletal-related events (SRE), and safety were also evaluated. At study week 13, the median percent reduction in uNTx/Cr was 71% for the pooled denosumab groups and 79% for the IV BP group. Overall, 74% of denosumab-treated patients (157 of 211) achieved a more than 65% reduction in uNTx/Cr compared with 63% of bisphosphonate-treated patients (27 of 43). On-study SREs were experienced by 9% of denosumab-treated patients (20 of 211) versus 16% of bisphosphonate-treated patients (seven of 43). No serious or fatal adverse events related to denosumab occurred. Subcutaneous denosumab may be similar to IV BPs in suppressing bone turnover and reducing SRE risk. The safety profile was consistent with an advanced breast cancer population receiving systemic therapy.
