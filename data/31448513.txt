Efficacy and safety of palbociclib plus endocrine therapy in North American women with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor indicated for treatment of hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of palbociclib in patients enrolled in North America during two-phase 3 trials: PALOMA-2 (n = 267, data cutoff: May 31, 2017) and PALOMA-3 (n = 240, data cutoffs: April 13, 2018, for overall survival, October 23, 2015, for all other outcomes). In PALOMA-2, treatment-naïve postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized 2:1 to palbociclib (125 mg/d; 3 weeks on/1 week off [3/1]) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/d, continuous) or placebo plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, patients who progressed on prior endocrine therapy were randomized 2:1 to palbociclib (125 mg/d; 3/1) plus fulvestrant (500 mg, per standard of care) or placebo plus fulvestrant; pre/perimenopausal patients received ovarian suppression with goserelin. Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy prolonged median progression-free survival vs placebo plus endocrine therapy in North American patients (PALOMA-2: 25.4 vs 13.7 months, hazard ratio, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.40-0.74], P < .0001; PALOMA-3: 9.9 vs 3.5 months, hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.38-0.72], P < .0001). Objective response and clinical benefit response rates were greater with palbociclib vs placebo in North American patients in both trials. While overall survival data are not yet mature for PALOMA-2, median overall survival was increased in PALOMA-3 (32.0 vs 24.7 months, hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.53-1.04]), though this did not reach statistical significance (P = .0869). Safety profiles in North American patients were similar to those of the overall populations; neutropenia was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event. No new safety signals were observed. In summary, palbociclib plus endocrine therapy is an effective treatment option for North American women with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.
