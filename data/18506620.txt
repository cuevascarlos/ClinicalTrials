Analysis of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea rates by three different anthracycline and taxane containing regimens for early breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) by newer taxane-containing regimens was evaluated in early breast cancer (EBC) patients. A prospective cohort of 122 premenopausal EBC patients participated in a phase III trial of preoperative docetaxel/capecitabine (TX) versus doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC); 34 patients received adjuvant AC followed by paclitaxel (T) and 129 patients received 5-fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC). The CIA rate was 90.2% with TX/AC, 73.5% with AC followed by T, and 72.1% with FAC at 1 year (P = 0.002), and 66.7%, 73.3%, and 58.9%, respectively, at 3 years (P = 0.268). At one year, age (P < 0.001) and taxane use (P = 0.002), and after two years, age and tamoxifen use were significant factors for CIA in multivariate analysis. Serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were significantly correlated with menstrual status, age, and tamoxifen use. Taxanes resulted in higher CIA rates in the first year, but age and tamoxifen use were significant factors for persistent CIA.
