Seroma prevention following axillary dissection in patients with breast cancer by using ultrasound scissors: a prospective clinical study. Seroma formation following axillary dissection is a common complication of breast surgery. The aims of this study were (1) to analyse the risk factors of seroma formation, and (2) to evaluate the role of ultrasound scissors in performing axillary dissection in patients with primary breast cancer undergoing mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery. Ninety-two women (median age 55 years, range 33-73 years) requiring surgery for known unilateral primary breast cancer (pT1a=1, pT1b=20, pT1c=43, pT2=25, pT3=3) were prospectively randomised to undergo axillary dissection by either using (Group A, 45 patients) or not using (Group B, 47 patients) ultrasound scissors (US). Thirty-eight (41.3%) patients underwent modified radical mastectomy, while 54 (58.7%) underwent breast-conserving surgery. Twenty-eight (30.4%) patients (Group A=9 out of 45, 20%; Group B=19 out of 47, 42%; P=NS) developed a wound seroma. Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model showed that surgical procedure (RR=8.9; 95% CI: 3.2-25.3), total amount of drainage (RR=7.8; 95% CI: 2.8-22.0), and size of the tumour (RR=6.0; 95% CI: 2.2-16.5) independently correlated with seroma formation. The logistic regression function (RR=19.4; 95% CI: 6-62) correctly allocated 75 out of 92 (81.5%) patients. Size of the tumour, and total amount of drainage represent the principal factors of seroma formation following axillary dissection in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. Although the use of ultrasound cutting devices may reduce the risk of seroma formation, further studies are need to verify the real impact on long-term morbidity of such technique.
