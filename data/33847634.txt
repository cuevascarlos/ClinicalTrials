Clinical study of combined application of indocyanine green and methylene blue for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of combined application of indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer. A total of 415 patients who underwent SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection were enrolled. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) was assessed in 197 patients with ICG and MB combination method, while, the other 218 patients were detected by MB method alone. During surgery, all SLNs were harvested for pathological examination. Then the detection rate and false negative rate of SLNs were comparatively analyzed between the 2 groups. In the combined ICG and MB group, the detection rate of SLNs was 96.9%, significantly higher than that of MB group, which was 89.7% (P < .05). Similarly, in combined group, the average number of SLNs per patient was 3.0, much higher than that of MB group, which was 2.1 (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference in false negative rate between combined group and MB alone group, which was 7.3% and 10.5%, respectively (P = .791). The combined application of ICG and MB for SLNB is much more effective than MB alone in detecting SLNs.
