Multicenter randomized phase III study of the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (Cardioxane) in advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has led to the adoption of empirical dose limits that may restrict continued use of anthracyclines among patients who might benefit. Dexrazoxane, a cardioprotective agent, has been shown to reduce the risk of anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity when given from first dose of anthracycline. This study sought to confirm the benefit of dexrazoxane in patients at high risk of cardiotoxicity due to prior anthracycline use. A total of 164 female breast cancer patients, previously treated with anthracyclines, received anthracycline-based chemotherapy either with (n = 85) or without (n = 79) dexrazoxane for a maximum of six cycles. Compared with those receiving anthracycline alone, patients treated with dexrazoxane experienced significantly fewer cardiac events (39% versus 13%, P < 0.001) and a lower and less severe incidence of congestive heart failure (11% versus 1%, P < 0.05). Tumor response rate was unaffected by dexrazoxane therapy. The frequency of adverse events was similar between groups and there were no significant between-group differences in the number of dose modifications/interruptions. Dexrazoxane significantly reduced the occurrence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction due to previous anthracycline treatment without compromising the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic regimen.
