Efficacy of tamoxifen following anastrozole ('Arimidex') compared with anastrozole following tamoxifen as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Anastrozole ('Arimidex') is indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Combined analysis of two international randomised, double-blind trials (n=1021) showed that in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours, first-line treatment with anastrozole significantly prolonged the time to progression (TTP) compared with tamoxifen (median TTP: 10.7 versus 6.4 months, respectively; P=0.022). Second-line tamoxifen following anastrozole, or vice versa, in this trial population was unblinded. The treatments were crossed over and then efficacy was assessed using a questionnaire. Of 511 patients randomised to anastrozole, 137 (26.8%) received second-line tamoxifen. Questionnaire data were available for 119 patients; 58 (48.7%) gained clinical benefit (CB=complete+partial response (CR+PR)+(stable disease (SD) >/=24 weeks)), while 12 (10.1%) had an objective response (OR=CR+PR). Of 510 patients randomised to tamoxifen, 134 (26.3%) received second-line anastrozole. Questionnaire data from 95 patients showed that 54 (56.8%) gained CB and 7 of the patients gaining CB (7.4%) had an OR. Previous studies showed anastrozole is effective after first-line tamoxifen. These data show that the sequential administration of first-line anastrozole followed by tamoxifen provides effective use of these drugs in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.
