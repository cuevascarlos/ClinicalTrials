Improving the quality of life in breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema. Certain treatments increase lymphedema risk in breast cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether quality of life improved with preoperative teaching by a lymphedema expert. Preoperative breast cancer patients were prospectively randomized into intervention group 1 or control group 2. Group 1 had a discussion with the lymphedema expert and at 6 months, in addition to the preoperative surgical discussion and literature given to all. Arm measurements and quality of life evaluation with Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer were completed preoperatively and at intervals for up to 3 years. Lymphedema was verified with a 10% increase in volume or circumference. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed on data. There were 119 evaluable patients with no differences between groups 1 and 2. The rate of acute lymphedema was 51.5% (33 of 64) for group 1 and 47.2% (26 of 55) for group 2. Chronic lymphedema presented in 13 patients (9.3% group 1 and 12.7% group 2). Lymphedema was significantly associated with number of lymph nodes resected (P < .001). Significant findings in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer were at 6 months for all and after diagnosis in lymphedema positive patients. Structured lymphedema teaching can help to improve quality of life in lymphedema patients.
