Single-center long-term results from the randomized phase-3 TARGIT-A trial comparing intraoperative and whole-breast radiation therapy for early breast cancer. Partial breast irradiation using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) after breast-conserving surgery could be sufficient for a selected group of breast cancer patients. We report the results of a cohort of patients from a single center treated as part of the randomized phase-3 TARGIT-A trial. Patients (≥50 years) with cT1 cN0 cM0 and invasive ductal histology on biopsy were randomized between IORT with 20 Gy (arm-A) or postoperative whole-breast RT (WBRT) up to 56 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (arm-B). Postoperatively, patients in arm-A with multifocality, lymphovascular invasion, nodal invasion, extensive intraductal component, invasive lobular carcinoma, or resection margins <1 cm received additional postoperative WBRT. Between 2002 and 2012, 184 patients were randomized, of whom 90 in arm-A and 90 in arm-B were evaluated. Median follow-up was 8.5 years. The 5‑year overall survival was 94.4% in arm-A and 93.3% in arm-B (p = 0.73). Two local recurrences were observed: one at 70.3 months in an arm-A patient who received IORT + WBRT and another at 4.5 months in an arm-B patient who refused all forms of adjuvant treatment, thus resulting in a 5-year local recurrence of 0% in arm-A and 1.1% in arm-B. The 5‑year in-breast recurrence (outside of the index quadrant) was 0% in arm-A and 1.2% in arm-B. Salvage mastectomy was performed successfully in all patients with relapse. Long-term follow-up of this single-center cohort consolidates the earlier reports of low local recurrence rates after single-dose IORT. Our results are in line with non-inferiority of risk-adapted IORT for selected patients with early breast cancer.
