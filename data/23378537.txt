The Patient's Anastrozole Compliance to Therapy (PACT) Program: a randomized, in-practice study on the impact of a standardized information program on persistence and compliance to adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Compliance and persistence are often overlooked in adjuvant breast cancer treatment. PACT was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open, parallel-group study assessing whether educational materials (EMs) enhanced compliance with aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in postmenopausal women with early, hormone-receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. The primary end points were compliance (proportion taking ≥ 80% anastrozole) at 12 months and persistence (proportion reporting anastrozole intake during the study period). Four thousand eight hundred and forty-four patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive standard therapy or standard therapy with EMs. There was no difference between arms in compliance (N = 2740; 88.5%/88.8%, respectively, P = 0.81) or persistence rates (N = 2740; 40.5%/43.0%, respectively, P = 0.18). Modified end point analyses found no differences in compliance between arms based on the classification of: (i) patients with missing documentation or follow-up visit <9 months as non-compliant (N = 4397, P = 0.15); (ii) patients with early (≤ 292 days) 12-month follow-up documentation excluded (N = 4091, P = 0.19); (iii) patients reaching ≥ 80% compliance during individual follow-up as compliant (N = 4397, P = 0.26). Modified persistence analyses found no difference between arms (N = 4397, P = 0.37). Addition of EMs to standard therapy did not significantly affect compliance and persistence with adjuvant anastrozole. CLINICALTRIALS ID: NCT00555867.
