Final results from the prospective phase III WSG-ARA trial: impact of adjuvant darbepoetin alfa on event-free survival in early breast cancer. WSG-ARA plus trial evaluated the effect of adjuvant darbepoetin alfa (DA) on outcome in node positive primary breast cancer (BC). One thousand two hundred thirty-four patients were randomized to chemotherapy either with DA (DA+; n = 615) or without DA (DA-; n = 619). DA (500 µg q3w) was started at hemoglobin (Hb) levels <13.0 g/dl (<12 g/dl after DA label amendment) and stopped at Hb levels ≥14.0 g/dl (12 g/dl after label amendment). Primary efficacy end point was event-free survival (EFS); secondary end points were toxicity, quality of life (QoL) and overall survival (OS). Venous thrombosis (DA+: 3.0%, DA-: 1.0%; P = 0.013) was significantly higher for DA+, but not pulmonary embolism (0.3% in both arms). Median Hb levels were stable in DA+ (12.6 g/dl) and decreased in DA- (11.7 g/dl). Hb levels >15 g/dl were reported in 0.8% of cycles. QoL parameters did not significantly differ between arms. At 39 months, DA had no significant impact on EFS (DA+: 89.3%, DA-: 87.5%; Plog-rank = 0.55) or OS (DA+: 95.5%, DA-: 95.4%; Plog-rank = 0.77). DA treatment did not impact EFS or OS in routine adjuvant BC treatment.
