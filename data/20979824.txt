[A pilot study of weekly versus 3-week docetaxel in combination with capecitabine in patients with anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer]. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly or 3-week docetaxel in combination with capecitabine. 83 Patients with at least one measurable lesion were randomized to receive the treatment arms: docetaxel 37.5 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, oral capecitabine 950 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 (Group A); docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on days 1, oral capecitabine 950 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 (Group B). Each cycle was repeated every 3 weeks. Eighty-three patients were enrolled, 78 eligible for tumor assessment. The overall clinical response rate of all groups was 61.4% (51/83). There was no progressive disease (PD) after two cycles. Efficacy outcomes were similar in the two groups. The response rate of group A and B were 61.8% (21/34) and 61.2% (30/49) respectively. There were no drug-related deaths observed. Neutropenia was the most common toxicity. In all, the frequency of Grade 3/4 neutropenia were 45.8% (38/83), but Grade 3/4 neutropenia of Group B 55.1% (27/49) was higher than Group A 32.4% (11/34), P = 0.04. The study confirmed the superior activity of docetaxe-capecitabine combination therapy in anthracycline resistant MBC, and comparing with 3-week schedule, weekly docetaxel plus capecitabine has same high efficacy with a favourable safety profile.
