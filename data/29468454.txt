Randomized phase II study of anastrozole plus tegafur-uracil as neoadjuvant therapy for ER-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal Japanese women (Neo-ACET BC). This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of anastrozole concurrent with tegafur/uracil (UFT) as neoadjuvant therapy for ER-positive postmenopausal breast cancer. Postmenopausal Japanese women with ER-positive, HER2-negative, T2,N0-1,M0 breast cancer seen at tertiary hospitals were eligible for this open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients were randomized 1:1 by minimization to orally receive either anastrozole (1 mg once daily) plus UFT (tegafur/uracil combination in 1:4 molar ratio; 270 mg/m2/day in two divided doses) or anastrozole (as above) alone for 24 weeks. Tumor response was assessed by investigator and central review as per RECIST v1.1. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR [clinical response rate (RR)] determined by central radiologic review. The study was prematurely terminated due to Grade ≥ 3 liver dysfunction reported in 3 patients receiving anastrozole/UFT. Of 57 patients randomized before termination (29 anastrozole/UFT, 28 anastrozole), all were analyzed for safety and 56 (28 each group) for tumor response. Compared with anastrozole alone, anastrozole/UFT did not achieve significantly higher RR [39.3% (90% CI 23.8-56.5%) vs 14.3% (90% CI 5.0-29.8%); p = 0.0683, Fisher's exact test], but produced significantly greater tumor shrinkage (mean tumor reduction rate 31.0 vs. 14.2%; p = 0.0181, unpaired t-test). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were more common with anastrozole/UFT than with anastrozole (17.2 vs. 0%). Although the study was terminated owing to the altered liver function, it showed that there was a trend to greater shrinkage of tumor in the combination group for ER-positive, HER2-negative postmenopausal breast cancer.
