A randomized Phase III trial of neoadjuvant recombinant human endostatin, docetaxel and epirubicin as first-line therapy for patients with breast cancer (CBCRT01). To further assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant human endostatin (rh-endostatin), a Phase III, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted. Patients to be treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel and epirubicin (DE) or DE plus rh-endostatin (DEE) were eligible for this trial. The primary endpoint was clinical/pathological response. Secondary endpoints included adverse events and quality of life (QOL). Finally, 803 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive DE (n = 402) or DEE (n = 401) regimen. After three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy, "complete response" achieved in 14.2% of patients in DEE group versus 6.7% in DE group, "partial response" achieved in 76.8% versus 71.1%, while "stable disease" in 6.0% versus 18.9%, "progressive disease" in 3.0% versus 3.2% of patients. The rate of objective response in DEE and DE group was 91.0% and 77.9%, respectively (p < 0.001). In spite of a relatively higher pathological complete response achieved following the combination therapy, no significant difference was found between two arms. Adverse events were mostly of Grades 1-2. No significant difference in adverse event and QOL was found between the two arms. In conclusion, the combination of chemotherapy and rh-endostatin achieved better outcomes than chemotherapy alone, and thus can be considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.
