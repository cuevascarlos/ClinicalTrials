Effects of concurrent aerobic and strength training on breast cancer survivors: a pilot study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a combined aerobic and strength program on physiological and psychological parameters in female breast cancer survivors. Randomised controlled trial. 20 patients (age: 45.6 ± 2.7 yrs) surgically treated for breast cancer that had completed all cancer therapies at least 6 months before and with no contraindications to physical activity, were recruited and randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 10) and a control group (n = 10). Intervention group patients attend to a 24-week combined aerobic and strength training program. Physiological (i. e. VO2max, bioelectrical impedance test, maximal strength of principal muscular groups) and psychological (i. e. functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue: FACIT-F) parameters were assessed at baseline and after 24 weeks. After 24 weeks the intervention group showed significant improvement in VO2max (38.8%), strength of upper and lower limbs (ranging from 13 to 60%) and decrease in fat mass percentage (-6.3%). The FACIT-F showed significant increase in all of the three scores that can be derived (FACIT-F Trial outcome: 13%; FACT-G total score: 18%; FACIT-F total score: 15%) showing patient's quality of life (QOL) improvement. No significant change in all the parameters was found for the control group. These results show the positive effects of a combined aerobic and strength training program on breast cancer survivors and underline the importance of the early inclusion of structured physical activity in the rehabilitation protocol.
