Randomized study of orally administered fluorinated pyrimidines (capecitabine versus S-1) in women with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer: Japan Breast Cancer Research Network 05 Trial. Capecitabine and S-1 are orally administered fluorinated pyrimidines with high-level activity against metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This randomized, multicenter, phase II study compared the activities and safeties of the oral fluoropyrimidines, capecitabine and S-1, in breast cancer patients. Patients with MBC were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine 825 g/m(2) twice daily on days 1-21 every 4 weeks or S-1 40-60 mg twice daily, according to body surface area, on days 1-28 every 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 142 patients were enrolled and randomized to either capecitabine (N = 73) or S-1 (N = 69). Median PFS (progression-free survival) was 1.2 years for capecitabine and 1.3 years for S-1, with a hazard ratio (S-1/capecitabine) of 0.85 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.52-1.38) (P = 0.48 by log-rank). The confirmed objective response rates were 24.0 % for capecitabine and 23.1 % for S-1 (P = 0.938). The most common treatment-related adverse events were grade 1-2 in intensity. Thrombocytopenia (S-1: 9.2 %, capecitabine: 1.4 %; P = 0.040) and nausea (S-1: 26.2 %, capecitabine: 14.1 %; P = 0.079) were more frequent in the S-1 group, while hand-foot syndrome occurred more often in the capecitabine group (S-1: 10.8 %, capecitabine: 25.4 %; P = 0.029). The results of the current study demonstrate that both S-1 and capecitabine are effective and well-tolerated treatments in patients with MBC, while their adverse events were different. They are both convenient, orally administered drugs, making them attractive agents for use in outpatient treatment.
