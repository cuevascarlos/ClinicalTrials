A randomized controlled Phase II trial of vinorelbine plus capecitabine versus docetaxel plus capecitabine in anthracycline-pretreated women with metastatic breast cancer. Previous studies have shown that vinorelbine/capecitabine (NX) and docetaxel/capecitabine (TX) chemotherapy has a certain effect in advanced breast cancer. However, there are few clinical studies directly comparing TX and NX regimen chemotherapy, especially in patients with advanced breast cancer previously treated with anthracycline and taxane. The purpose of this Phase II study was to compare survival and side effects between patients with anthracycline- and taxane-resistant advanced breast cancer treated with NX and those treated with TX chemotherapy. From February 2012 to March 2014, a total number of 97 patients were randomly assigned to NX (n = 55) or TX (n = 42). Baseline characteristics were relatively well-balanced in the two treatment arms. The clinical trial registration number (clincaltrials. gov) is NCT01635465. After a median follow-up of 46.0 months, there was no significant difference between the NX and TX arms in objective response rate (17.9% vs. 21.1%; P = 0.686) and progression-free survival (6 months vs. 7 months; P = 0.560). The overall survival period of the TX arm was longer than that of the NX arm (32 months vs. 27 months) but without statistical significance. Both regimens were well-tolerated. The main toxicities were neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia. In the TX arm, hand-foot syndrome occurred more frequently than in the NX arm (P < 0.01), but frequencies of other minor adverse effects were similar between the two arms. NX and TX regimens are both alternative treatments for patients with anthracycline- and taxane-resistant advanced breast cancer, but the safety profile was more favorable and manageable with the NX regimen.
