Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Saforis for prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Oral mucositis (OM) is a frequent complication of mucotoxic cancer therapy, causing significant oral pain, increased infection risk, and impaired functioning. The efficacy and safety of Saforis (glutamine) powder in UpTec for oral suspension was evaluated for the prevention and treatment of OM. Three hundred twenty-six patients developing World Health Organization (WHO) grade >or=2 OM during a chemotherapy screening cycle were randomized to Saforis (n = 163) or placebo (n = 163) 3 times/day during their next chemotherapy cycle (Treatment Cycle 1). Patients were crossed over to the alternate treatment during Treatment Cycle 2. As prespecified in the statistical plan, because of a carryover effect in Treatment Cycle 2 the primary efficacy analysis was based on Treatment Cycle 1 only. Compared with placebo, Saforis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant WHO grade >or=2 OM (38.7% vs. 49.7%; P = .026) and severe WHO grade >or=3 OM (1.2% vs. 6.7%; P = .005) in Treatment Cycle 1. Saforis also significantly reduced the worst Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale ulceration score in Treatment Cycle 1 compared with placebo (mean, 0.23 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.45; P = .013). Patients receiving Saforis in Treatment Cycle 1 had a lower-than-expected OM incidence when crossed over to placebo in Treatment Cycle 2, indicating a significant carryover effect (P = .027). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between groups. Saforis is safe and effective for preventing and treating OM in patients receiving mucotoxic cancer chemotherapy.
