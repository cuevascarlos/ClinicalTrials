Evaluation of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) in clinically axillary node negative breast cancer patients - Randomised controlled trial. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is an important procedure for control of axillary nodal metastasis in breast cancer patients. Lymphedema, restriction of shoulder movement and axillary nodal recurrence are the most disabling complications of the procedure. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) procedure for arm lymph node identification emerged as a step for their preservation during ALND. Here we are testing the effect of ARM on lymphedema development and whether it compromises oncological safety in early breast cancer patients. 98 clinically node free breast cancer female patients undergoing completion ALND after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy were recruited in the study. They were put into group A (49 patients with ARM + ve preservation ALND) and group B (49 patients in the conventional ALND group). ARM procedure was performed in both groups, ARM positive nodes were preserved in group A, marked and taken out with other axillary LN in group B. The outcome was histopathology of ARM + ve LN, development of arm lymphedema, and restriction of shoulder movement on follow-up. ARM was positive in 46 patients (93.8%) in group A and 43 patients (87.8%) in group B, ARM + ve LN revealed positive metastasis only in 1 patient (2.3%) in group B. Lymphedema developed in 3 (6.5% patients in group A and 9 patients (20.9%) in group B. Restriction of shoulder movement showed a non-significant difference between the two groups. Axillary reverse mapping and preservation of arm lymphatics helped to decrease the lymphedema rate without compromising oncological safety in early breast cancer.
